    <h1>Privacy Policy for Flags Tutor</h1>
    <p class="updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> April 1, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Flags Tutor. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>Audio Data</h3>
    <p>Flags Tutor requests microphone access solely for the purpose of allowing users to verbally guess flag names during the learning experience. Important details about audio usage:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All audio processing occurs in real-time and locally on your device</li>
        <li>No audio recordings or voice data are stored, saved, or transmitted from your device</li>
        <li>Voice input is immediately processed and discarded after each guess</li>
        <li>Audio data is never used for any purpose beyond the immediate flag-guessing functionality</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <p>Our app may automatically collect certain non-personal information, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device information (model, operating system)</li>
        <li>App performance data</li>
        <li>Usage statistics</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the limited information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide the core functionality of Flags Tutor (real-time flag guessing)</li>
        <li>Analyze app usage to improve user experience</li>
        <li>Fix bugs and troubleshoot technical issues</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Regarding audio data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>NO audio or voice recordings are ever stored on your device or on our servers</li>
        <li>NO audio data is ever transmitted from your device</li>
        <li>All voice processing happens locally and temporarily within the app</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other app data is protected using industry-standard security measures to prevent unauthorized access.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to third parties. We do not collect or store any personal information that could be shared.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is designed for educational purposes and may be used by children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since voice data is only processed in real-time and never stored, no personal voice information is collected from users of any age.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect or store personal data beyond basic device information required for app functionality, there is no personal data to access, correct, or delete. However, you can always:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Control microphone permissions through your device settings</li>
        <li>Uninstall the app at any time to remove any app-related data from your device</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>
